# Why the need of of setup.py?
Setup.py helps install folders as local packages? What do you mean by local packages? 
This means that I can do from src.cnnclassifier import data ingestion, had it not been for setup.py
it would have thrown an error. How does it identify what folders need to be treated as local packages?
it looks for __init__.py inside each directory and wherever present it treats them as local packages

# How is setup.py script initiated? Whenever we do pip install -r requirements.txt ity looks for -e variable and
then initiates the setup.py
